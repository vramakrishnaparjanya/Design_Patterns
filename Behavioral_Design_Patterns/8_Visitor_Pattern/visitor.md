# **Visitor Pattern**

* The Visitor Design Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows you to add further operations to objects without modifying their structures. 
* It achieves this by letting you define a new operation in a separate class (the visitor) and passing it to the objects it needs to act upon.


#### Key Components of the Visitor Design Pattern:
1. **Visitor**: An interface or abstract class that declares operations to be performed on different object types.
2. **Concrete Visitor**: A class implementing the Visitor interface that provides specific implementations for each type of object it visits.
3. **Element**: An interface or abstract class that declares an accept method to accept visitors.
4. **Concrete Elements**: Classes implementing the Element interface and providing specific implementations for the accept method.
5. **Object Structure**: A collection of elements that can be iterated and visited.

- This pattern is often used in scenarios like compiler design, document processing, and operations on complex object structures.
