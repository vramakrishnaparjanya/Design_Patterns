**Template Design Pattern**



####  Key Advantages of the Template Method Pattern:

- Code Reusability: Common parts of the algorithm are implemented in the template method, reducing code duplication.
- Code Consistency: Enforces a consistent workflow across different implementations.
- Extensibility: New variations of the algorithm can be created by simply creating new subclasses.
- Inversion of Control (Hollywood Principle): The parent class controls the order of execution, "Don't call us, we'll call you."



- When to use the Template Method Pattern:
- When you have an algorithm with some steps that can be implemented in different ways. 
- When you want to avoid code duplication among similar algorithms. 
- When you want to control the order of operations in an algorithm. 
- This example clearly illustrates the Template Method pattern and its benefits. It should help you understand and apply this pattern effectively in your own projects.
