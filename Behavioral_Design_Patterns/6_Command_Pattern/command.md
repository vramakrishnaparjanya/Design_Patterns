# **Command Pattern**

* The Command Pattern is a behavioral design pattern used to encapsulate a request as an object, allowing for parameterization of clients, queuing of requests, and logging of operations. 
* It decouples the sender of a request from its receiver 


#### Key Benefits of Using the Command Pattern
1. **Decoupling**: Separates the sender and receiver, making the system easier to maintain.
2. **Flexibility**: Easy to add new commands without altering existing code.
3. **Undo/Redo Functionality**: By storing executed commands, the pattern can support undo/redo features.
