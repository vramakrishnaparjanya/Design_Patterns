**Chain of Responsibility Design Pattern**



####  Key Advantages of the Chain of Responsibility Method Pattern:

1. **Handler:** Defines an interface for handling requests and optionally sets the next handler in the chain.
2. **Concrete Handlers:** Implement the handler interface, handle specific parts of the request, or pass it along the chain.
3. **Client:** Initiates the request and determines the entry point of the chain.
