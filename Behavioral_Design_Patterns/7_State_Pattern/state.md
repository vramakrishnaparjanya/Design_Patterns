# **State Pattern**

* The State Design Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows an object to alter its behavior when its **internal state changes**. 
* It provides a way to encapsulate state-specific behavior within different state classes, making the code more organized, maintainable, and extensible.


#### Key Benefits of Using the State Pattern
1. **Context**: Maintains an instance of a State subclass that defines the current state.
2. **State**: An interface or abstract class defining the behavior that concrete state classes should implement.
3. **Concrete States**: Classes that implement the State interface and define behavior for a particular state.
