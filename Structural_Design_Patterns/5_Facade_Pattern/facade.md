# **Facade Pattern**

* provides a simplified interface to a larger, more complex subsystem
* hides the complexities of the subsystem from the client and makes the subsystem easier to use

#### Key Characteristics of the Facade Pattern

1. **Simplifies Subsystems**:
   - The facade shields clients from the complexity of the subsystem by exposing only what is necessary.


2. **Loose Coupling**:
   - Clients depend only on the facade, not on the subsystem components.
      

3. **Improves Code Organization**:
   - It helps organize the subsystem into a cleaner and more modular structure.
