**Singleton Pattern Principles**
- Singleton pattern restricts the instantiation of a class and ensures that only one instance of the class exists in the JVM.
- The singleton class must provide a global access point to get the instance of the class.
- Singleton pattern is used for logging, drivers objects, caching, and thread pool.
- Singleton design pattern is also used in other design patterns like Abstract Factory, Builder, Prototype, Facade, etc.
- Singleton design pattern is used in core Java classes also (for example, java.lang.Runtime, java.awt.Desktop).
